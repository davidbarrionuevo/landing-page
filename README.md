Hello,

My name is David Barrionuevo, I am currently learning the front-end of web development. 


This is my second project from The Odin Project, the Landing Page project. In this project I am creating a mock home 
page with HTML and CSS skills previously learned, in addition to recently acquired flexbox, margin, and padding 
knowledge.
